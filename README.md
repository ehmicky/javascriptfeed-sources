# JavaScript Feed Sources

[https://javascriptfeed.com](https://javascriptfeed.com)

JavaScript Feed aggregates the best JavaScript, web development, and
Node publications from around the web. We utilize RSS feeds from high quality
content providers to bring all the best articles to one place.

## Adding a Source

The content of JSF is owned by the community. The types of feeds we currently support are:

1. General XML feeds from around the web
2. Feeds mapped to Medium users/publications
3. Feeds mapped to Medium custom domains

To submit a new resource, create a pull request with either the URL or Medium
account under the appropriate data structure in `index.js`. We will review the
content of the publication and include it if it passes the guidelines.
